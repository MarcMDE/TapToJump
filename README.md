# TapToJump
Simple and fun runner prototype, developed using C and raylib.

The game build is ready to play, just download the build/TapToJump_v1_0_@MarcMDE and open the .exe!!!
If you want, you can download it form: https://mega.nz/#!qRFwDLCK!ilQvnBqDCmkFDUKk6bUzgQIeMB8fiXaYJNsQXfFh4bg

The code is actually pretty dirty, and there are some issues. I wanted to finish it as fast as posible, as my
objective developing it was learn and practice some features for the GlobalGameJam16

Give it a try, fast to download, fast to start playing, lots of fun :P
